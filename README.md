# Temperature Controlled Ryobi Hot Melt Adhesive Gun

A Replacement Control Board for the R18GLU Hot Glue Gun to display voltage, 
battery percentage, current, and allow for PID Temperature Control.

## Features
This is a drop-in ((Screw in and solder to)) replacement Controller PCB,
which provides a few upgraded features:

* OLED Display which shows
    * Requested and Actual Temperature
    * Current draw from battery
    * Voltage of the battery pack
    * Estimated battery percentage/battery bar

## How do I install this mod?
This upgrade will require Ordering PCBs & Parts, Soldering, Modifying the
chassis, and barrel of the Glue Gun as well as 3D Printing.  
TCRHMAG is a hobby project and is not intended to be a beginner project for
everyone, and may be rough around the edges.  
If the demand gets high enough I may provide a shop where parts for this project
(Assembled PCBs and 3D Printed Parts) might be available.
